# Learning Layout — Template from "Фрілансер по життю"

This repository was created as part of my frontend learning journey. I'm studying HTML, CSS, and layout development with the help of the YouTube channel [Фрілансер по життю (Freelancer LifeStyle)](https://www.youtube.com/c/FreelancerLifeStyle).

The template used for practice was provided by the channel's author. In this project, I'm specifically practicing working with **Flexbox** layout.
